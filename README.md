# Psychometric Test Web App (Excel Engineering College)

## What this does
- Student-facing web form for 50-question psychometric test.
- Generates **Student PDF** (shows only overall percentage, level, and recommendations â€” no raw scores).
- Generates **Teacher PDF** saved on the server with full scores and per-question answers.
- Password-protected teacher dashboard to download reports and export CSV.
- Default teacher username/password for testing: `teacher` / `password` (change on host via env vars).
